# Athenaeum

Athenaeum is collection of various library components. Most of these are based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) packages.

Most of these components used to exist inside their own repositories (and packages).
However, due to limited time it became somewhat of a burden having to maintain so many package.
Therefore, I decided to migrate them into a single package.
