# Introduction

The `Aedart\Testing` namespace contains various testing utilities.

## Prerequisite

Most testing utilities require [Codeception](https://codeception.com/).
Please ensure that you have installed Codeception as a dependency or [dev-dependency](https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#require-dev), in your [composer.json](https://getcomposer.org).
