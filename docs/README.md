# Athenaeum

Athenaeum is collection of various library components. Most of these are based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) packages.

The majority used to exist inside their own repositories (and packages).
However, due to limited time, it became a burden having to maintain that many repositories.
Therefore, I decided to migrate them into a single package.

Please explore the [available components](/components/).
