Athenaeum is a [mono repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo); a collection of various packages. 
The majority are based on well known components, such as those offered by [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).
A few of the offered packages are:

### [Config](archive/current/config)

_A configuration loader, supporting *.ini, *.json, *.php, *.yml and *.toml._

### [Core](archive/current/core)

_A custom Laravel Application implementation, intended to be integrated into legacy applications._

### [Circuits](archive/current/circuits)

_A Circuit Breaker to encapsulate failure prevention logic._

### [Dto](archive/current/dto)

_Data Transfer Object abstraction._

### [Http Clients](archive/current/http/clients) 

_Http Client wrapper, with a Manager able to handle multiple "profiles". It also comes with a powerful request builder, supporting Json API and OData http queries._

### [Support](archive/current/support) 

_Aware-of Helpers for Laravel and DTOs._

## Not a Framework

Athenaeum shouldn't be mistaken for a framework, despite the amount of packages that are offered.
The packages are merely helpers and utilities...
