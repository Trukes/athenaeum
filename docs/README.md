Athenaeum is a [mono repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo); a collection of various packages. 
The majority are based on well known components, such as those offered by [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).
Some of the key packages that are offered by Athenaeum, are the following:

### [Config](archive/current/config)

_A configuration loader, supporting *.ini, *.json, *.php and *.yml._

### [Core](archive/current/core)

_A custom Laravel Application implementation, intended to be integrated into legacy applications._

### [Dto](archive/current/dto)

_Data Transfer Object abstraction._

### [Http Clients](archive/current/http/clients) 

_Http Client wrapper, with a Manager able to handle multiple "profiles"._

### [Support](archive/current/support) 

_Aware-of Helpers for Laravel and DTOs._

## Not a Framework

Despite the amount of packages, you should not mistake Athenaeum for a framework.
It is not the intent nor purpose of this mono repository to act as a framework.
The majority of the offered packages, are merely helpers and utilities.
