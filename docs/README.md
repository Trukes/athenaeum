Athenaeum is a collection of various library components. Most of these are based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) packages.

The majority used to exist inside their own repositories (and packages).
However, due to limited time, it became a burden having to maintain that many repositories.
Therefore, I decided to migrate them into a single package.
If you have previously used any `Aedart\*` packages, then you should be able to find most of those components here.

Please explore the [available components](/archive/current/).

## Not A Framework

It is not the intent nor purpose of this package to act as a framework.
As previously mentioned, it's just a collection of utilities.
