# Origin

## The Origin of Athenaeum

Some years ago, I started to develop packages and make them public via [packagist](https://packagist.org/).
They were nothing special, but they helped me achieve a few tasks a bit faster or more desirable.
After a while, a few packages became many.
Whenever I had to upgrade them, it took more and more of my spare time.
Therefore, I decided to create a single repository, in hopes that it would become much easier to maintain.
Sadly, as a consequence of this, the list of dependencies grew.
A few of my friends and colleagues made me aware, that I had gone against good package development principles.
Due to this, I spent time to reshape Athenaeum into a true [mono repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo) (_since version `v4.0`_).
