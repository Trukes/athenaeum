# IoC Service Container

The `\Aedart\Container\IoC` is a slightly adapted version of [Laravel's Service Container](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x/container).
Please make sure to read their documentation, before attempting to use this version.

::: tip Info
IoC stands for [Inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control).
:::

The motivation behind this adaptation is development outside a normal Laravel Application.
E.g. testing and development of Laravel dependent packages.
In other words, you will most likely not find this useful within your Laravel Application!
