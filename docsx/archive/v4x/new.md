# New to this...

If you aren't familiar with Laravel, chances are good that most of the Athenaeum packages are somewhat confusing to understand.
That's completely okay.
In this chapter, you can find a few resources that can help you get started. 

## The Bare Minimum

Learning new technologies and frameworks isn't always easy, especially when time is against you.
If that's the case for you, then the bare minimum understanding you should gain, are the following few concepts:

- Service Container
- Facades
- Service Providers 

If you manage to learn about these concepts, you stand a far better chance of understanding how some of the Athenaeum packages work. 

## Laravel's Official Documentation

You could start by going through Laravel's [official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x).
It has really good and up-to-date information, on all of the major aspects.
In particular, you should focus on [Architectural Concepts](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/container).
It contains everything you need to know, in order to satisfy the bare minimum.

## Or... `~41` minutes of Laracast

[Laracast](https://laracasts.com) contains some of the best video tutorials, that I know.
It contains over 1.500 lessons and will surely get you up to speed on Laravel, PHP, Testing, Vue.js and much more.
Yes, it does **cost a bit of money**, but you do not have to commit for more than a month, if it is not to your liking[1].

If this is a viable option for you, then you could consider the following lessons, before going through all of the available lessons (_membership is required_).

- [The Basics of the Service Container](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch/episodes/38), `~5` minutes
- [Dependency Injection via Service Container](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch/episodes/39), `~11` minutes
- [Facades](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch/episodes/40), `~14` minutes
- [Service Providers](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-6-from-scratch/episodes/41), `~11` minutes

The above tutorials are just about enough, to gain a basic understanding of the previous mentioned concepts.

## Other Concepts

There are many more concepts, components, packages, tips & tricks, all of which are worth knowing.
But, ... in all honesty, you should just _take your time_ learning the basics and toy around with it, before jumping into more complex areas.
